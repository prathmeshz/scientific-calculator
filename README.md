## Code Structure

**Back-End**
> Using [Udo klimaschewski's EvalEx](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx) repo on Java Expression parsing, the calculator is able to take in a String equation and evaluate the mathematical answer returned in BigDecimal. For operations that EvalEx does not handle, we wrote our own methods in Numbers.java. MainActivity.java contains all Button Listener instructions, separated in half by basic calculator buttons on top and scientific calculator functions below. We decided to use only Buttons and Textviews to limit the possibility of invalid user input. 

**Layout**
> The calculator's UI is comprised of a series of nested linear (weighted) and relative layouts. Visual attributes of the buttons are assigned/managed using one style. Button's onclick appearance was also customized. When confronted with interface/user experience issues, we found that implementing a HorizontalScrollView enabled us to display equations exceeding layout boundaries, while the ToggleButton widget helped circumvent the issue of a crowded interface/inefficient use of space. Layout code was mainly handled by Jae with input, debugging, and modifications contributed by Sufei.
