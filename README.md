## Code Structure

**Back-End**


**Layout**
The calculator's UI is comprised of a series of nested linear (weighted) and relative layouts. Visual attributes of the buttons are assigned/managed using one style. Button's onclick appearance was also customized. When confronted with interface/user experience issues, we found that implementing a HorizontalScrollView enabled us to display equations exceeding layout boundaries, while the ToggleButton widget helped circumvent the issue of a crowded interface/inefficient use of space. Layout code was mainly handled by Jae with input, debugging, and modifications contributed by Sufei.
